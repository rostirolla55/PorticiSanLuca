The link between the <b>Portico of San Luca </b>in Bologna and
<b>Carl'Antonio Facci </b>(or Carlo Antonio Facci) concerns the
funding and devotion that allowed the construction of this imposing
architectural work.</p>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">Here are the main
details:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Who was
	Carl'Antonio Facci: </b>He was a wealthy Bolognese <b>silk merchant
	</b>who had his shop on Via delle Chiavature, in the heart of
	Bologna's historic center.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Contribution
	to the Portico: </b>Like many other wealthy citizens, corporations,
	and noble families of the time, Facci contributed financially to the
	construction of the portico. His name is particularly linked to a
	section of the <b>Portico di Pianura </b>(the flat stretch from Via
	Saragozza to the Arco del Meloncello).</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>The
	inscription: </b>Near Arch <b>101 </b>(according to some historical
	cataloguings, such as the <i>Catalogo de' Devoti </i>), there is or
	was mentioned an inscription that reads: <i>&quot;DEL SIGNOR
	CARL'ANTONIO FACCI. 1779&quot; </i>. This date indicates the period
	in which the merchant offered his contribution for the construction
	or completion of that specific section.</p></li>
	<li><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm"><b>Historical
	context: </b>The Portico of San Luca, nearly 4 km long and composed
	of 666 arches, was built between 1674 and 1793 almost entirely
	thanks to <b>private donations </b>. The participation of people
	like Carl'Antonio Facci testifies to the deep devotion of the people
	of Bologna to the Madonna of San Luca and the desire to contribute
	to a work that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm">In short, Carlo
Antonio Facci was not an architect, but one of the <b>generous
(devoted) financiers </b>who made it possible to build the longest
portico in the world as an act of faith and civic pride.</p>
